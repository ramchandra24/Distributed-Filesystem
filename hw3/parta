Part A
a)	Bigger Files
Bytes per block = 512

Per inode,
10 block numbers = 10*512
1 indirect pointer = 128*512
1 double-indirect pointer = 128*128*512
1 triple-indirect pointer = 128*128*128*512

Total file size supported = 512*(10+128+128*128+128*128*128)
    = 1082201088 bytes

1.1)	As files larger than 1GB size need to be stored, Ben has to –

B. Increase just the number of bytes per block from 512 to 2048 bytes. 
D. Replace one of the direct block numbers in each inode with an additional
triple-indirect block number.

1.2)	B. Decreasing the size of a block number from 4 bytes to 3 bytes.
C. Decreasing the size of a block number from 4 bytes to 2 bytes.


b)	EZ Park
4.1) 
A. There is a race condition in accesses to available[], which may violate one of the
correctness specifications when two find_spot ( ) threads run.
C. There is a race condition in accesses to numcars, which may violate one of the
correctness specifications when more than one thread updates numcars.

4.3)	The code doesn’t meet its specifications. Suppose a thread acquires a lock, and doesn’t find an available slot, the lock is never released. Even when RELINQUISH_SPOT() is called for a client, the available slots can’t be updated because the lock is not free.

4.4)	The code doesn’t meet the specifications. Suppose all slots are occupied and multiple clients are calling FIND_SPOT(), a client who wants to relinquish the spot may not be able to do so when the lock is being acquired continuously by the clients calling FIND_SPOT().

4.5)	The code doesn’t meet specifications. Consider a case when lock is acquired by a client, it is never released unless one of the clients call RELINQUISH_ SPOT(). Hence, clients may not be able to use available slots.

4.6)	A. The client will not get a response until at least one car relinquishes a spot.
B. The client may never get a response even when other cars relinquish their
spots.

4.7)	A. The server may be running multiple active threads on behalf of the same client
car at any given time.
D. numcars may be larger than the actual number of cars parked in the parking lot.

4.8)	A. On any thread switch, the operating system saves the values of the PMAR, PC,
SP, and several registers.
D. The number of instructions required to switch from one thread to another is
proportional to the number of bytes currently on the thread’s stack.
